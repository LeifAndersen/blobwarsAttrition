Gameplay Manual
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Blob Wars : Attrition is a mission and objective-based 2D platformer. It is the third entry in the Blob Wars series and is set between the events of Metal Blob Solid and Blob and Conquer. The story centres around an alien invasion of the Blobs' homeworld and their fight back against the aggressors. Many of Bob's fellow blobs have been assimilated by alien technology and become evil. During the game, you take control of a blob named Bob, whose mission it is to rescue MIA and fight back against the enemy. The gameplay is non-linear, allowing the player to tackle missions in any order they prefer.
</p>

<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
<p>
To quickly start playing the game:
<ul>
	<li>Run the Blob Wars executable (./blobWarsAttrition on Linux, blobWarsAttrition.exe) on Windows).</li>
	<li>Choose New Game and select a save slot.</li>
	<li>On the world map screen, use the mouse or keyboard control to select the Beach Approach mission.</li>
	<li>Play and complete the training mission to proceed with the game (or quit the mission to proceed more quickly).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>
Most missions in the game feature mulitple objectives which are listed at the start of the level. Those objectives listed in red are required to be completed. Those listed in white are optional and can be completed at any other time. Once all the objectives have been completed, the mission will automatically end and the player will be returned to the World Map. They can then choose to play the mission again, to complete all the outstanding objectives and collect keys that they missed before.

<h4>Keys</h4>
<p>
Keys and keycards to open doors can be found scattered throughout the missions in Attrition. Spare keys not used in a level are carried between levels once the mission ends (or the player quits). This is important, as not all the doors on one level will have a matching key. For example, a level might contain two gold doors, but only one gold key. In this instance, the player would need to find a gold key on another level.
