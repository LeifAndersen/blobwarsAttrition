msgid "This is an information point. Bob can stand by them for a few moments to see what they have to say. There are many scattered throughout this tutorial map, to help you learn how to play. They will also appear from time to time during the actual game. Stand by them for a short time, to get more information. If you get lost, tap the radar icon in the top left, to view a map of the local area."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a door. To open it, simply walk into it. Most doors are locked, and some will require a key."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is an item. Walk into it to pick it up. Some items, such as keys, are carried between levels, while other items will form part of mission objectives, and must be collected."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a pressure plate. Walking on it will cause things to happen, such as doors to open."
msgstr ""

msgid "Water. Bob can swim in water so long as he has oxygen. You can also activate your aqua lung, which will enable Bob to swim for longer. Your oxygen returns when Bob exits the water."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is slime. Falling into slime hurts Bob, and will deduct 1 point of health. Best avoided."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is lava. It hurts more than slime, causing 2 points of damage."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is a lift here, that Bob can ride. Lifts can also be used to transport things."
msgstr ""

msgid "This door is locked, and required a bronze key to open it."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a teleporter. It can transport Bob (and other things) to a new location. Simply walk into it to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "These are POW blobs, that have been captured by the enemy. They need to be transported home. To do so, simply walk into them to initiate the teleportation process."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a power point. It can recharge Bob's power. To use it, simply walk over it. It will stop working for a time once it has recharged Bob's power, and must be left alone before it can be used again."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a Power Point. It is used to activate entities in the world, such as doors. Power Points require that Bob use a certain amount of power to activate them. To do so, stand over them for a short time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another pressure plate. This one, however, requires constant pressure to be applied."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a crate. It is heavy, and can be used to weigh down pressure plates. Bob will encounter many such crates and boulders throughout the game."
msgstr ""

msgid "You must go right, first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stuck? You can either wait for the lift or activate your jetpack. Activating your jetpack underwater will activate your aqualung, instead. Both require Power to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are enemies here. Fire your weapon to attack them. Defeated enemies will drop cherries, weapons, and batteries, as well as many other items they are holding. You should collect health and batteries as often as possible."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Rescue 4 MIAs"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeat all enemies"
msgstr ""

msgid "Find all keys and keycards"

msgid "You're about to come across the detachment leader, marked with a red arrow above him. He has more energy than regular enemies, and may teleport away while you're battling him. Check surrounding area to find out where he has gone."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remember that you can use your aqualung underwater to swim for longer than your oxygen level could otherwise allow."
msgstr ""

msgid "A power cell! This will increase your overall power by 1 point, allowing you to use your jetpack and aqualung for 1 second longer. There are many more to be found."

msgid "Teeka has relayed information that there are a lot of card readers here, but no keycards. They need to be obtained from other locations. Consider returning later, when you have a good stash of them to hand."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bob made his way through cherry fields as a fierce storm beat down, heading towards Teeka's last known position."
msgstr ""

msgid "But as he arrived in the vicinity, Bob found only the scout's teleporter belt. Teeka was nowhere to be seen."
msgstr ""

msgid "As the rain continued to fall, Bob couldn't help but feel that he had been lured away from home base on purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bob knew he should get back to the Blobs' base as soon as possible. He made to leave, only to come face-to-face with a BioMech ambush."
msgstr ""

msgid "With his direct route home cut off, Bob would have no choice but to fight his way through."
